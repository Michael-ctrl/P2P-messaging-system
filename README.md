# TCP-messaging-system

## Aim
To develop a TCP client and server for an instant messaging system/forum that supports concurrent users. The clients are able to connect to the forum to send messages and transfer files between users via TCP.

## Initialisation
Start up the server with
```
python3 server.py (server_port)
```
and start the client with
```
python3 client.py (server_port)
```
Note: fields in brackets are variables to be set upon by the user. If no ports are added, a default value will be used.
